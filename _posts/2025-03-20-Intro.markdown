# Introduction to my blog
Hello, I'm Juliusz Tolko, I work as a Cybersecurity Engineer

I'm going to do a series of posts sharing my knowledge in order to help myself deepen my knowledge, and hopefully help some people.

The first series of posts will cover creating and applying security best practices for a Microsoft 365 tenant with a Business Premium license.

See you soon,
