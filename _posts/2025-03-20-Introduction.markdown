Hello, I'm Juliusz Tolko, I work as a Cybersecurity Engineer

I'm going to do a series of posts in order to share my knowledge and hopefully help some people.

The first series of posts will cover creating and applying security best practices for a Microsoft 365 tenant with a Business Premium license.

See you soon,
